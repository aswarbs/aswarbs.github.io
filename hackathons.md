I like to go to Hackathons and make fun projects for myself and others to enjoy. Here are some of my favourite projects my friends and I have made! You can find more technical information by clicking links in the sections and most of the code is on [my](https://github.com/aswarbs) or [Toby](https://github.com/tobybenjaminclark)'s Github.
