Intermew was made by Toby and I at [Durhack 2024](https://devpost.com/software/intermew). We webscraped job listings from sites like Indeed, and generated 3 stage interviews to talk through with a chatbot. You get evaluated on metrics like semantic performance (the content of what you are saying), facial expressions (do you come across as stressed?) and head positioning!
