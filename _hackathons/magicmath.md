Magicmath was made by Toby and I at [GreatUniHack 2024](https://devpost.com/software/magicmath). It was inspired by Apple Intelligence ([Math Notes](https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2024/06/ipados-18-introduces-powerful-intelligence-features-and-apps-for-apple-pencil/)) - but on a physical whiteboard. We captured images of the whiteboard using a camera, which was placed on top of a projector, which projects answers on the whiteboard. This project won <span style="color: #FFA500;">**Reply's AI Agents Prize**, **Hackiest Hack**, and **5th Runner Up!**</span>
