Wotsitbot was made by Toby, Daudi, Adrian and I at [HackTheBurgh 2024](https://devpost.com/software/wotsitbot). A user drives around a small robot, and clicks on things they can see in the world, allowing them to learn what they are, and a little more about them. Adrian built a differential drive robot, which the user navigated. Toby made an interface for the user to see what the robot is seeing and take pictures of the world. I segmented the images from the robot and generated information about the object they selected. Daudi defined interfaces for the different components of the system.
