title: Brain Controlled Robot Painting
---

[Brain Controlled Robot Painting](https://github.com/aswarbs/brain-controlled-robot-painting) is a robotic installation designed to create paintings based on the participant's brain activity data. The project uses the EEG [Muse 2](https://eu.choosemuse.com/products/muse-2) band to collect the participant's brain activity data, which is then sent to a [UR3e](https://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur3e/) arm that creates a painting based on the data!
